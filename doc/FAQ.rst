What is PyViz, really?
======================

PyViz is a set of examples that help you see how various Python packages can work together to solve a huge range of visualization problems, from common situations to tricky special cases.  Although there is an installable package named ``pyviz``, it's valuable mainly for its dependencies, which are a coherent set of libraries designed to work well together. There is almost no code actually in PyViz, apart from the examples in the tutorials.


Is PyViz a commercial product?
==============================

PyViz is supported by `Anaconda, Inc. <http://anaconda.com>`_, but PyViz and all of its component packages are open source packages freely available for both commercial and non-commercial use.


Wow, how did you do all this work?
==================================

The real work is in the individual projects, not here. :) We're just trying to show you how much is now available across the different projects, and can only take credit for making good examples.


How do I report a problem?
==========================

And those projects are also usually to blame for your problems. ;)  If your issue is with this website, the notebooks you downloaded from it, or the ``pyviz`` package, then please open an issue on `github.com/pyviz. <https://github.com/pyviz/pyviz/issues>`_ Otherwise, please visit the appropriate website for whichever package is involved, using the links on the `PyViz home page. <index.html>`_  If it is not clear what to do, you can always try describing your problem on the `Gitter channel for HoloViews. <http://gitter.im/ioam/holoviews>`_
