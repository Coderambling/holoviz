    "When exploring data it can be convenient to use the `.plot` API to quickly visualize a particular dataset. By calling `.plot` to generate different plots over the course of a session, it is possible to gradually build up a mental model of how a particular dataset is structured. While this works well for simple datasets, it can be more efficient to build a linked visualization with support for direct user interaction as a tool for more rapidly gaining insight.\n",

    "In particular, with interlinked plots you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Interactively explore high-dimensional data by making selections across different views of the same underlying samples.\n",
