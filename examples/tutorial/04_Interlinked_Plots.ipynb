For instance, try selecting the deepest earthquakes (around 600), and you can see that those are not specific to one particular magnitude. You can then further select a particular magnitude range, and see how that range is distributed in depth over the selected depth range.

By calling `.plot` to generate different plots over the course of a session, it is possible to gradually build up a mental model of how a particular dataset is structured. While this works well for simple datasets, it can be more efficient to build a linked visualization with support for direct user interaction as a tool for more rapidly gaining insight.\n",
