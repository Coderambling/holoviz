    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "When exploring data it can be convenient to use the `.plot` API to quickly visualize a particular dataset. By calling `.plot` to generate different plots over the course of a session, it is possible to gradually build up a mental model of how a particular dataset is structured. While this works well for simple datasets, it can be more efficient to build a linked visualization with support for direct user interaction as a tool for more rapidly gaining insight.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the workflow presented here, building such custom interaction is relatively quick and easy and does not involve throwing away prior code used to generate simpler plots. In the spirit of 'short cuts not dead ends', we can use the HoloViews output of `hvplot` that we used in our initial exploration to build rich visualizations with custom interaction to explore our data at a deeper level. \n",
    "\n",
    "These interactive visualizations not only allow for custom interactions beyond the scope of `hvplot` alone, but they can display visual annotations not offered by the `.plot` API. In particular, we can overlay our data on top of tile sources, generate interactive textual annotations, draw shapes such a circles, mark horizontal and vertical marker lines and much more. Using HoloViews you can build visualizations that allow you to directly interact with your data in a useful and intuitive manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, the earthquakes plotted were either filtered early on by magnitude (`>=7`) or dynamically to analyse only the earthquakes within a small geographic distance. This allowed us to use Bokeh directly without any special handing and without having to worry about the performance issues that would be occur if we were to try to render the whole dataset at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section we will see how such large datasets can be visualized directly using Datashader."
