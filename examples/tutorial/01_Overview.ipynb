    "   * create simple but powerful apps and dashboards out of anything in a Jupyter notebook\n",
    "   * make simple but powerful plots out of Pandas dataframes and Xarray multidimensional arrays\n",
    "   * handle columnar data, big data, geo data, array data\n",
    "   * handle the whole process from getting the data in, cleaning it, exploring it visually, creating plots for communication, building dashboards for sharing your analyses, and deploying dashboards."
